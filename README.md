# 9

9 is a game where you start with one 1 but the objective is to get two 8s and merge them.
When two tiles with the same number touch, they <b>add 1 more number.</b>

Most of the time, the game will spawn a 1 after every move you make.
If you hold down the up arrow for long enough, you might get a 2 to spawn.

<i>2s are 1 in every 1000 1s</i>


If you continue, you will probably get more 2s or perhaps a 3.

<i>3s spawn roughly 1 in every 5000 1s</i>


Every time you get a 3, the game has decided to randomly give you it instead of a 4.

<i>4s spawn roughly 1 in every 20 3s</i>


But that's only the first half. The chance of you getting the second half (5,6,7,8) is about 1 in every 50000 1s.

Therefore,

<i>5s are 1 in every 50000 moves</i>


If you been playing for a long time then you may get some 5s. But like 3s, there is a different option.

<i>6s are roughly 1 in every 25 5s</i>


So you would have realised that the chance of you getting a 4 instead of a 3 is higher than the chance of you getting a 6 instead of a 5.
As far as I know, no one has ever had a 6, and you'll know if you have got one, because they are red.


<b><i>The impossible dimension is approaching, be aware.</i></b>

<i>7s spawn roughly 1 in every 5000 5s</i>


But,

<i>8s are only 1 in every 10 7s</i>

and,

<i>9s are only 1 in every 2 8s</i>


The overall chance that the tile you are about to receive is a 7 or 8 or 9 is 100000 x 50000 x 5000 or <i>1 in every 25000000000000 moves.</i>


<b>YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO SPAWN ANY 7s OR 8s OR 9s</b>
